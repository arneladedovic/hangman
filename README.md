# Hangman
Hangman is a Python Terminal game. Users can try to guess the word by inputting letters until they guess the word and win or lose the game by running out of tries.

### How to play:
* Start by choose either reading the rules or start the game.
* When player start the game, the program randomly chooses one word from the list with 300 different words.
* The word is represented with underscores to show how many letters are in the word.
* If the letter is correct, the underscore will be replaced with the correct letter.
* If the letter is wrong, the player will lose a "live" until there is zero lives left. The player gets 6 tries.
* The player wins when the word is guessed and loses if the lives runs out. 
* If the player wins/loses, the menu will start over. 

### Wireframes/FlowChart

During the planning proccess I made a Flowchart to set the basic steps to help guide my coding process. 
As the game is played in the terminal, no wireframes is made for a visual look.

### Design

The game is very limited because of it is played trough the terminal. 
More information about future design is written under [Future Features](#future-features)
